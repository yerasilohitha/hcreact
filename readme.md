This is a simple Counter App built on the first day of my React learning journey.

ğŸš€ What I Learned
Used the useState hook to manage the counter value.

Built a UI with two buttons:

ğŸ”¼ Increase â€“ Increments the counter.

ğŸ”½ Decrease â€“ Decrements the counter.

âœ… Features
Counter increases up to a maximum value of 20.

Counter decreases only down to a minimum value of 0.

Values are constrained to stay within this 0â€“20 range.
